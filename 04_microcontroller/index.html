<h3>Week 4: Microcontroller Programming</h3>

<h4>Stable Air Controlled Actuator</h4>

<p class="margin">   
  For this week's assignment, I created a larger actuator and figured out how to
   control it with the air pump (the actuator and connection must be leak-free)
  instead of the water pump. First, I 3D printed a large actuator mold:
</p>

<image style = "width: 50%"src = "../04_microcontroller/wk4LrgMolds.jpg" alt = "Large Actuator Mold"> </image>

<p class="margin">   
  To make the extra actuator bodies, I mixed AB silicon solution in a cup and used a vacuum former to remove any air bubbles, which
  were a major issue since they resulted in the formation of gaps in the molded silicon (credit to Nathan 
  for directing me to the vacuum-former).
</p>

<image style = "width: 50%"src = "../04_microcontroller/wk4VacuumNoBubbles.jpg" alt = "Bubbles Removed by Vacuum"> </image>

<p class="margin">   
  I filled my main mold with AB silicon solution. Once the silicon solidified, I removed the 
  central rod and threaded the exterior of the actuator:
</p>

<p class="margin">   
  Then, I cut a piece of canvas fabric and joined it to the bottom of the actuator with silicon
  to serve as a strain-limiting layer. Once this solidified, I inserted a tube into the actuator and
  plugged the tube's surroundings with silicon:
</p>

<p class="margin">   
  Once solidified, I cut away the excess silicon:
</p>

<p class="margin">   
  Then, I reconfigured the breadboard to add an external 12V power source to the pump (credit to Bobby for helping 
  me realize that my 12V and ground cables were reversed):
</p>

<image style = "width: 50%"src = "../04_microcontroller/wk4Microcontroller.jpg" alt = "Some of My Initial Materials"> </image>

<p class="margin">   
  I connected the actuator to the pump. I initially planned on
  using only one of the two pump air valves and reversing the voltage to change
  the direction of air flow. But I realized that reversing direction of air flow in the 
  valves did not work. To solve this, I used a three-way connector and pinched one of 
  the tubes with my hands to control air flow (credit to Kassia for the pinching idea).

<p class="margin">   
  Here is the code (edited version of last week's) I used in Arduino to adjust and alternate the pump motor
  speed (Bobby helped with setting up PWM):
</p>

<pre>
<code>
const int A1A = D0;  // define pin 12 for A-1A (PWM Speed)
const int A1B = D1;  // define pin 14 for A-1B (direction)

// setting PWM properties
const int freq = 5000;
const int resolution = 8;

void setup() {
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  ledcAttach(A1A, freq, resolution);
  ledcWrite(A1A, 0);   // start with the motors off 
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // start the motor at a high speed
  ledcWrite(A1A, 255);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
  delay(2000);              // allow the motor to run for 2 seconds
  // start the motor at a low speed
  ledcWrite(A1A, 200);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
  delay(2000);              // allow the motor to run for 2 seconds
}
</pre>
