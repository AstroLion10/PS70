<h3>Week 6: Electronic Inputs</h3>

<h4>Assignment 1: Capactive Sensor<h4>
<p class="margin">   
  To make the capacitive sensor, I put copper tape onto two pieces of cardboard and connected them to 
  a circuit breadboard.

  I then recorded the Arduino values I saw at various distances and graphed them on desmos
  to find a line of best fit. Although different from the actual physics-based graph, the line type that best 
  fit the data points (highest r^2 value) was an exponential function. This may be a result of the jumpy Serial
  Plotter readings, or I may have needed to take more data points at high distances. Below is a screenshot of my
  plotted points and best-fit line:

  To further callibrate, I could integrate this function 
  into the Arduino code so that it prints distances to the Serial Monitor that are close to the actual distances
  between the two plates. Below is a photo of my circuit configuration:

<h4>Assignment 2: Flex/Pressure Sensor</h4>
<p class="margin">   
  I created a velostat flex sensor to use for the soft robotic glove. This sensor can help with finger motion tracking
  in addition to glove actuator automation for the final project. 
</p>

<p class="margin">
  To make the sensor, I followed instructions on <a href="https://lucstechblog.blogspot.com/2018/04/flex-and-pressure-sensors.html">Lucs Tech Blog</a>. 
  First, I took a piece of masking tape. Then, I cut a short length of copper tape and gently folded the sticky side onto itself to make a flexible,
   thin copper plate. I centered this copper piece on the tape. After this, I cut two identical small velostat rectangles. Then, I placed one
   rectangle on top of the copper plate (the velostat should be wider and cover the whole copper plate). I added the other piece 
   of velostat on top of the first and placed the next copper plate (making sure it does not touch the first copper plate). Lastly,
   I sealed the other side with masking tape. This made the finished sensor. I would recommend using a more insulating tape material for future 
   velostat sensors, as touching the paper masking tape with a conductive hand might potentially affect the sensor reading. 
   Here is the finished sensor:

  To test it, I hooked up both of the copper ends to a multimeter and measured the sensor's 
  resistance when it was bent at different angles.
