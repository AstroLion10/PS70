<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Movable Soft Robot Finger</h4>

<p class="margin">   
  I created a soft robotic finger based designs from the <a href="https://softroboticstoolkit.com/about">Soft Robotics Toolkit</a>. 
  This movable finger will be an initial test for me to gradually work towards the creation of 
  my final project, an integrated soft robotic exoskeleton glove. In soft robotics terminology,
  the finger I created is called an actuator.
</p>

<h5>Design Process:</h5>

<p class="margin">  
I initially planned on creating a mechanical finger using motors, chords, and wood panels to 
test the mechanics of my overall glove design in a simplified form. After talking with Nathan,
he suggested that I try soft robotics instead of microelectronics to make the glove. I was 
initially unsure, but with further research, I realized that soft robotics is indeed a much more 
effective and feasible strategy for the product I want to create.
</p>

<p class="margin">  
I used instructions on how to make an actuator from the Soft Robotics Toolkit (SRT). 
To make the actuator, I first 3D printed molds from the SRT.
