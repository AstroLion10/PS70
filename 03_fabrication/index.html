<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Movable Soft Robot Finger</h4>

<p class="margin">   
  I created a soft robotic finger based designs from the <a href="https://softroboticstoolkit.com/about">Soft Robotics Toolkit</a>. 
  This movable finger will be an initial test for me to gradually work towards the creation of 
  my final project, an integrated soft robotic exoskeleton glove. In soft robotics terminology,
  the finger I created is called an actuator.
</p>

<h5>Design Process:</h5>

<p class="margin">  
I initially planned on creating a mechanical finger using motors, chords, and wood panels to 
test the mechanics of my overall glove design in a simplified form. After talking with Nathan,
he suggested that I try soft robotics instead of microelectronics to make the glove. I was 
initially unsure, but with further research, I realized that soft robotics is indeed a much more 
effective and feasible strategy for the product I want to create.
</p>

<p class="margin">  
I used instructions on how to make an actuator from the Soft Robotics Toolkit (SRT). 
To make the actuator, I first 3D printed molds from the SRT.
</p>

<image style = "width: 75%"src = "../03_fabrication/printedMold.jpg" alt = "3D Printed Actuator Mold"> </image>

<p class="margin">  
  I coated the molds with mold release and a bit of oil to prevent the silicon from sticking.
</p>

<image style = "width: 75%"src = "../03_fabrication/greasingMolds.jpg" alt = "Spraying Mold Release"> </image>

<p class="margin">   
  Then, I poured liquid silicon solution into the mold and clamped it to let the actuator body solidify. 
</p>

<p class="margin">   
  Afterwards, I wrapped the actuator with a thin synthetic thread per the SRT intructions.
  This thread will help translate the extension of the actuator along its own length
  and inhibit it from bulging outwards.
</p>

<image style = "width: 75%"src = "../03_fabrication/threadingActuator.jpg" alt = "Wrapping the Actuator with Thread"> </image>

<p class="margin">   
  I mixed a new batch of liquid silicon solution and poured some into the larger, final mold.
  Then I placed the actuator body inside, poured silicon on top, and closed the mold.
</p>

<p class="margin">   
  While the actuator was solidifying, I began testing how to wire and program the pump that will move the 
  actuator. I gathered some initial materials: My microcontroller, the pump, and a PVC pipe.
</p>

<image style = "width: 75%"src = "../03_fabrication/pumpMaterials.jpg" alt = "Some of My Initial Materials"> </image>

<p class="margin">   
  I connected the microcontroller to an L298N on a breadboard, and I used a modified version of
  code from the PS70 motor tutorial in Arduino. Below is the code I used for the pump:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
  const int A1A = D0;  // define pin D0 for A-1A 
  const int A1B = D1;  // define pin D1 for A-1B 

  int intakeTime = 500;
  int outputTime = 500;

  void setup() {
    pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
    pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // start with the motors off 
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);

  }

  void loop() {
    // output air 
    digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    delay(intakeTime);              // allow the motor to run for 4 seconds

    // stop the motor
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // setting both pins LOW stops the motor 
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);   // redundant, but doesn't hurt 
    delay(2000);              // keep the motor off for 2 seconds

    // input air
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
    delay(outputTime);              // allow the motor to run for 4 seconds

    // stop the motor
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // setting both pins LOW stops the motor 
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);   // redundant, but doesn't hurt 
    delay(2000);              // keep the motor off for 2 seconds

  }
</code>
</pre>

  Since the pump I used was a water pump. I intended to place a water container inside the PVC
  pipe for the pump to suck water from, so I 3D printed a base and lid for the pipe for me 
  to mount the breadboard and pump on.
