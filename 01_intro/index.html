<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<h4>Idea 1 : Assistive Exoskeleton Astronaut Glove</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
On spacewalks, over half of injuries to astronauts are to the hands. Further, conducting precise maintenance operations 
while inside a pressurized spacesuit is incredibly difficult, and astronauts have to apply a large amount of force
to the spacesuit glove each time they bend their fingers or try to grab an object. This difficulty is a result of
the high pressure difference inside and outside the spacesuit, making it feel as if trying to bend an inflated, rigid
balloon. Many efforts have been made to mitigate limitations to movement for the current NASA suit, and it certainly
has done an excellent job, lasting many decades to support astronauts in space.

In order to improve astronauts' hand dexterity when conducting spacewalks in the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), 
my final project idea is to create a robotic glove that can provide an assistive force for the astronauts' hands when 
they bend their fingers. This could make spacewalk operations easier and more effecient by saving time and decreasing 
risk of injury to the astronauts by alleviating much of the force they have to apply to the glove.

My first idea for creating this glove is to create an "underlayer" that could potentially be added underneath the existing 
astronaut glove layers. I would be able to focus more on the new technology and electronics this way without having to 
initially worry about making the other components of an astronaut glove.

After testing and refining the technology, I would then create a fully integrated astronaut glove by embedding the assistive 
exoskeleton technology into a full EMU glove mock-up.

Below is my initial sketch of the exoskeleton glove design:

<h4>Idea 2: Self-Organizing Shelf</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I could make a bookshelf with five "shelves." Each shelf would sense the weight of the object on it and adjust the shelf's height accordingly.
