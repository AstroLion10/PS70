    Hello! My name is Hallel Chery. I am a current first-year at Harvard, and I am planning on concentrating
    in Mechanical Engineering. The reason I chose this concentration is I want to create products and
    solutions to can solve real-world problems for the benefit of humanity. I am especially interested in the 
    space sector, but I'm also interested in solving important problems on Earth such as water scarcity and 
    access to education.

For fun, I enjoy assembling 3D models of machines, particularly space-related ones like
my metal model of NASA's opportunity rover! I also like to play the piano and golf. I love classical music, and 
my favorite orchestral composer is Antonio Vivaldi - the four seasons are the best.
I'm excited to learn all of the content covered in this class, and I plan to put the skills gained to use in creating 
prototypes related to space exploration.
