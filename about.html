    Hello! My name is Hallel Chery. I am a current first-year at Harvard, and I am planning on concentrating
    in Mechanical Engineering. The reason why I chose this concentration is that I want to create products and
    solutions that can solve real-world problems for the benefit of humanity. I especially want to create products in
    the space sector, but I am also interested in solving important problems on Earth such as water scarcity and 
    access to education.

For fun, I enjoy assembline 3D models of machines, especially space-related ones like
my metal model of NASA's opportunity rover! I also like to play the piano and golf. I love classical music, and 
my favorite orchestral composer is Antonio Vivaldi - especially the four seasons.
I am excited to learn all the content of this class, and I plan to put the skills I learn to use in creating prototypes
for products and solutions related to space exploration.
